## 🚀 Deploy

Push your app to a remote server with one command:

```bash
./sbin/qbixserver.php --deploy=production
```

Configure targets in `config/deploy.json`:

```json
{
    "targets": {
        "production": {
            "host": "myserver.com",
            "user": "deploy",
            "path": "/var/www/myapp",
            "key": "~/.ssh/deploy_key",
            "dirs": ["web", "handlers", "classes", "config"]
        }
    }
}
```

The command rsyncs each directory to the remote server. If the remote runs Qbix Server, it can be configured to hot-reload on deploy.

Servers can also be managed from the Panel's **Servers** tab — add, deploy, and remove remote servers through the browser.

## 🔗 Federation

Qbix servers can forward events to each other. Any `Q::event()` call can be handled locally or routed to a remote server — same dispatch path, same handler signature, transparent to the app code.

### How it works

**1. Server identity.** On first run, each server generates a self-signed certificate and stores it in `local/server.crt`. The SHA-256 fingerprint is the server's identity — like SSH `known_hosts`, no certificate authority needed.

**2. Discovery.** Every server exposes `/.well-known/qbix.json`:

```json
{
    "server": "Qbix Server",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "fingerprint": "11cf953679b80d04...",
    "endpoints": {"event": "/Q/event", "health": "/Q/health"},
    "plugins": [{"name": "Users", "version": "1.0"}]
}
```

**3. Event forwarding.** Configure which events route to which server:

```json
{
    "Q": {
        "handlersUsingRemote": {
            "Users/login": {"baseUrl": "https://auth.example.com"},
            "Streams/stream": {"baseUrl": "https://streams.example.com"}
        }
    }
}
```

When Server A receives a `Users/login` event, it forwards it to `auth.example.com/Q/event` via HMAC-signed POST. The receiving server verifies the signature, dispatches the event locally, and returns the result. Loop prevention is built in — a forwarded event is never re-forwarded.

**4. Signing.** All inter-server requests are signed using `Q_Utils::sign()`, which is compatible with the Qbix Platform's signing. The signature uses HMAC-SHA1 over recursively key-sorted, URL-encoded data — the same format the Platform uses. Servers upgrading to the full Platform keep working without changes.

### Trust levels

Servers authenticate each other at three levels:

- **Pinned peer** — fingerprint stored in config. Events accepted, signature
  verified. For known partners.
- **Owned server** — shared `Q.internal.secret`. Full trust, can forward
  user sessions. For your own infrastructure.
- **Public** — no fingerprint, just HTTPS. Read-only access via
  `/.well-known/qbix.json`. For open APIs.

### Logging

Access and error logs with buffered writes, daily rotation, gzip archiving, and retention management. Enable by adding a `log` section to config:

```json
{
    "Q": {
        "webserver": {
            "log": {
                "dir": "logs",
                "access": true,
                "error": true,
                "bufferSize": 65536,
                "flushInterval": 1,
                "maxSize": 52428800,
                "archiveAfterDays": 2,
                "deleteAfterDays": 30,
                "fileMode": null,
                "dirMode": "0755"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dir` | `logs/` (relative to app root) | Log directory. Absolute paths work too. |
| `access` | `true` | Write access.log in combined format + response time. |
| `error` | `true` | Write error.log with timestamps. |
| `bufferSize` | `65536` (64 KB) | Buffer log lines in memory, flush when full. 0 = write every line immediately. |
| `flushInterval` | `1` | Seconds between timer flushes. Buffer contents hit disk at most this late. |
| `maxSize` | `52428800` (50 MB) | Rotate mid-day if a log file exceeds this. |
| `archiveAfterDays` | `2` | Compress rotated logs to .gz after this many days. |
| `deleteAfterDays` | `30` | Delete archived logs older than this. |
| `fileMode` | unset | Permissions for the log files, as octal digits in a string: `"0640"`. Unset means a file is created at `0666` minus the umask, usually `0644`. |
| `dirMode` | `"0755"` | Permissions for the log directory. Set explicitly, it is enforced past the umask; left alone, it behaves as it always has. |

#### Who can read your logs

An access log names the people who visited and what they asked for. Created at the umask, it is `0644` — readable by every account on the machine. On a box that is only yours that may be fine; on a shared one, or on anything holding personal data, it is not.

```json
"log": { "dir": "/var/log/qbix", "fileMode": "0640", "dirMode": "0750" }
```

Both keys are applied when the file is created, not after: the mode is in place before the first byte, so there is no moment in which the file exists more widely readable than you asked. That holds for the files rotation creates, and for the `.gz` an archive run writes — a compressed log is the same log and gets the same mode.

#### One Unix user per site

Where each site runs as its own user and a group needs to read across them, the pair to use is a setgid directory and group-readable files:

```json
"log": { "dir": "/var/log/qbix", "fileMode": "0660", "dirMode": "2770" }
```

The setgid bit passes the directory's group to everything created inside it. It does not grant the group anything — that is what `fileMode` is for, and why the two belong together.

Two things to know before setting this up:

- **Set the group first.** `chgrp webops /var/log/qbix`, then start the server. Linux drops the setgid bit silently when the process setting it is neither root nor a member of the directory's group, so the order matters.
- **`chmod` needs ownership.** If the directory already exists and belongs to somebody else, the mode cannot be applied; the server says so once on startup rather than failing to start or complaining per file.

**Buffered writes** accumulate log lines in memory and flush them in a single `write()` syscall — either when the buffer fills or on the timer. This cuts the per-request overhead roughly in half vs writing every line:

| Mode | Throughput | Overhead vs no logging |
|---|---|---|
| No logging | 9,276 req/s | — |
| Buffered (64KB, 1s) | 8,671 req/s | 6.5% |
| Unbuffered | 8,186 req/s | 11.7% |

Error lines always flush immediately (they're rare and you want them on disk before a crash). Set `access` to `false` to skip access logging entirely.

**Rotation:** Logs rotate daily at midnight. The current day's log is always `access.log` and `error.log`. Yesterday's becomes `access.2026-08-11.log`. After 2 days that file is gzipped to `access.2026-08-11.log.gz`. After 30 days it's deleted. If a log exceeds 50 MB mid-day, it rotates early with a timestamp suffix.

Access log format (nginx-compatible combined + response time):

```
192.168.1.1 - - [11/Aug/2026:14:30:00 +0000] "GET /api/users HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "-" "Mozilla/5.0" 3.2ms
```

Errors also go to stderr, so `php sbin/qbixserver.php 2>err.log` works without config.

### Configuration

```json
{
    "Q": {
        "internal": {
            "secret": "your-shared-secret-here"
        },
        "federation": {
            "advertise": true,
            "advertiseApps": false,
            "advertisePlugins": true,
            "requireKnownPeers": false,
            "peers": [
                {
                    "name": "auth-server",
                    "url": "https://auth.example.com",
                    "fingerprint": "11cf953679b80d04..."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Full-stack microservices

Each Qbix server is a complete, independent app server. Federation lets you split your app across multiple servers without changing your code:

```
Server A (auth.example.com)     Server B (app.example.com) ├── Users plugin                ├── App handlers ├── handlers/Users/*            ├── handlers/MyApp/* └── handles Users/ events       └── forwards Users/ → Server A
```

Server B's handlers call `Q::event('Users/login', $params)` as if Users were installed locally. The server transparently forwards it to Server A, gets the result, and returns it. The handler never knows the difference.

### Loop prevention

Every forwarded event carries a unique `_msgId`. Each server tracks seen IDs in memory (1-hour TTL). If a message ripples through A→B→C→A, server A recognizes the ID and drops it. This is per-message, not per-peer — works for any topology.

### Signing

Inter-server requests are signed two ways, both compatible with the Qbix Platform:

- **Body signature** — `Q_Utils::sign()` adds a `Q.sig` field using
  HMAC-SHA1 over recursively key-sorted data. Same format the Platform uses.
- **Header signature** — `X-Q-HMAC` header over the raw JSON body. Same
  as the Platform's curl-based `handleUsingRemote`.

The receiving server accepts either. A Platform server and a standalone Qbix Server can forward events to each other without configuration changes.
