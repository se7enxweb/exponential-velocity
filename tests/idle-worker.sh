# Regression test: idle workers must survive.
#
# An octane worker blocks on readExact() between requests. PHP applies
# default_socket_timeout to that read, so without an explicit
# stream_set_timeout() the read returns '' after 60s idle, readExact()
# reports it as EOF, and the worker exits. The pool only notices when it
# dispatches, so the first N requests after an idle period (N = worker
# count) come back 502 "Worker died".
#
# Waiting 60s per assertion would be useless in CI, so the server is
# started with a 2s default_socket_timeout: the bug reproduces in seconds
# and the fix has to hold regardless of the ini value.
#
#   ./tests/idle-worker.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
