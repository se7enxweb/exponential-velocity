# Regression test: setcookie() reaches the client, and sessions survive.
#
# Cookies are collected in Q_Response, which lives in the worker. The
# parent built the response and read its own copy of that state, which is
# always empty, so no cookie a script set ever went out. header('Set-Cookie:
# ...') worked, because that is an ordinary header and travels with the
# response — which is why this looked like a session bug rather than a
# cookie one.
#
# Nothing said so. The script ran, the status was 200, the body was right,
# and the browser simply never got a cookie: every request started a fresh
# session, so nothing could stay logged in and a captcha could never
# validate, since the code it stored was in a session the next request
# could not find.
#
#   ./tests/cookies-sessions.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
