# Regression test: SCRIPT_NAME and PHP_SELF carry the script's path.

# They were built as '/' . basename($scriptPath), which is right only for a
# script in the document root. Anything in a subdirectory lost it: an
# application under /shop/ was told it lived at /, and every absolute URL
# it built from SCRIPT_NAME went one or more directories too high.
#
# The page still came back 200 with the right HTML, which is what made it
# hard to see. It simply arrived unstyled, because every stylesheet href
# was wrong, and posting a form went somewhere else. Against a server that
# reports SCRIPT_NAME properly the same application looks completely
# different — that difference is the whole symptom.
