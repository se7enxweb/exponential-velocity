# Regression test: a class that appears during a request keeps its statics.
#
# Classes declared after the boot snapshot were added to it using their
# declaration defaults, and reset to those after every request. That is not
# a state they were ever in. Composer's ClassLoader builds its include
# helper once, behind a null check:
#
#     private static $includeFile;                 // implicitly null
#     ...
#     if (self::$includeFile !== null) return;     // already built
#     self::$includeFile = \Closure::bind(...);
#
# Set back to null, the guard reports "already built" is false — no, worse:
# the helper is null and the loader calls it anyway, so the second request
# died with "Value of type null is not callable", raised from class_exists()
# inside vendor code with nothing to connect it to a static being cleared.
#
# Every application using Composer is exposed, which is nearly all of them.
# Here the shape is reproduced directly: a class initialising a static once
# and relying on it afterwards.
#
#   ./tests/lazy-statics.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
