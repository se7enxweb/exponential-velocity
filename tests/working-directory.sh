# Regression test: a script runs with its own directory as the working
# directory, the way mod_php and fpm run it.
#
# A persistent worker has no reason to change directory, so it kept the one
# the server was started in. Every relative path in an application then
# resolved against the server's directory: includes missed, and writes
# landed in the server's tree. Exponential put its template cache there,
# read a half-written file back on the next request and died on a parse
# error naming a file it had never heard of — three directories away from
# anything it owned.
#
# The directory is restored afterwards, so a script that chdir()s cannot
# leave the worker pointed somewhere else for the next request.
#
#   ./tests/working-directory.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
